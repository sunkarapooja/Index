->jmbo50spI am comparision models 
current model is spacy ner 
so we have huge amount of data I am checking spacy ner really fit or not
other wise we have to choose alternative things

I am working model comparision NN 
I have applied preprocessing steps on current model checked with kartheek for 
what we need inthe data so every word and character important he said
so preprocessing not sutable for this data whatever they have done is fine basically
model giving 40 percent accuracy and they did preprocessing on prediction data 
and checking comparision on prediction actual data then only they got 52 accuracy

I am checking different models like bilstm,bert,allennlp,deepvlov 
but we need dataset we have data but we don't have dataset as per last discussion
we need annotated data i am checking kartheek and sunil on that

mean while we have biobert model developed by dims labs
this model trained with 18millian bioinformatic pubmed articles 
we have model weights so I want to check with our test data
